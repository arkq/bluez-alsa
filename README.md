# Bluetooth Audio ALSA Backend

[![Build Status](https://github.com/Arkq/bluez-alsa/actions/workflows/build-and-test.yaml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/Arkq/bluez-alsa/actions/workflows/build-and-test.yaml)
[![Code Coverage](https://codecov.io/gh/Arkq/bluez-alsa/branch/master/graph/badge.svg)](https://codecov.io/gh/Arkq/bluez-alsa)

This project is a rebirth of a direct integration between [BlueZ](http://www.bluez.org/) and
[ALSA](https://www.alsa-project.org/). Since BlueZ >= 5, the build-in integration has been removed
in favor of 3rd party audio applications. From now on, BlueZ acts as a middleware between an
audio application, which implements Bluetooth audio profile, and a Bluetooth audio device.

The current status quo is, that in order to stream audio from/to a Bluetooth device, one has to
install [PulseAudio](https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/PulseAudio), or use BlueZ < 5.
However, BlueZ version 4 is considered to be deprecated, so the only reasonable way to achieve
this goal is to install PulseAudio.

With this application (later named as BlueALSA), one can achieve the same goal as with PulseAudio,
but with less dependencies and more bare-metal-like. BlueALSA registers all known Bluetooth audio
profiles in BlueZ, so in theory every Bluetooth device (with audio capabilities) can be connected.
In order to access the audio stream, one has to connect to the ALSA PCM device called `bluealsa`.
Please note that this PCM device is based on the [ALSA software PCM I/O
plugin](https://www.alsa-project.org/alsa-doc/alsa-lib/pcm_external_plugins.html) - it will not be
available in the [ALSA Kernel proc
interface](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/sound/designs/procfile.html).

## Installation

autoreconf --install
mkdir build && cd build

issue](https://github.com/Arkq/bluez-alsa/issues/13))

```sh
../configure --enable-aac --enable-ofono --enable-debug --disable-payloadcheck
```

## Configuration & Usage

The main component of BlueALSA is a program called `bluealsa`. By default, this program shall be
run as a root during system startup. It will register `org.bluealsa` service in the D-Bus system
bus, which can be used for accessing configured audio devices. In general, BlueALSA acts as a
proxy between BlueZ and ALSA.

For details of command-line options to `bluealsa`, consult the [bluealsa man
page](./doc/bluealsa.8.rst).

In order to stream audio to the e.g. Bluetooth headset, firstly one has to connect the device. The
most straightforward method is to use BlueZ CLI utility called `bluetoothctl`. When the device is
connected one can use the `bluealsa` virtual PCM device as follows:

```sh
aplay -D bluealsa:DEV=XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX,PROFILE=a2dp Bourree_in_E_minor.wav
```

Setup parameters of the bluealsa PCM device can be set in the local `.asoundrc` configuration file
like this:

```sh
cat ~/.asoundrc
defaults.bluealsa.service "org.bluealsa"
defaults.bluealsa.device "XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX"
defaults.bluealsa.profile "a2dp"
defaults.bluealsa.delay 10000
```

BlueALSA also allows to capture audio from the connected Bluetooth device. To do so, one has to
use the capture PCM device, e.g.:

```sh
arecord -D bluealsa capture.wav
```

Using this feature, it is possible to create Bluetooth-powered speaker. It is required to forward
audio signal from the BlueALSA capture PCM to some other playback PCM (e.g. build-id audio card).
In order to simplify this task, there is a program called `bluealsa-aplay`, which acts as a simple
BlueALSA player. Connect your Bluetooth device (e.g. smartphone) and do as follows:

```sh
bluealsa-aplay XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX
```

For details of command-line options to `bluealsa-aplay`, consult the [bluealsa-aplay man
page](./doc/bluealsa-aplay.1.rst).

In addition to A2DP profile, used for high quality audio, BlueALSA also allows to use phone audio
connection via SCO link. One can use either build-in HSP/HFP support, which implements only audio
related part of the specification, or use [oFono](https://01.org/ofono) service as a back-end. In
order to open SCO audio connection one shall switch to `sco` profile like follows:

```sh
aplay -D bluealsa:DEV=XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX,PROFILE=sco Bourree_in_E_minor.wav
```

The list of available BlueALSA PCMs (provided by connected Bluetooth devices with audio
capabilities) can be obtained directly from [BlueALSA D-Bus API](doc/bluealsa-api.txt) or using
`bluealsa-aplay` as a convenient wrapper as follows:

```sh
bluealsa-aplay -L
```

In order to control input or output audio level, one can use provided `bluealsa` control plugin.
This plugin allows adjusting the volume of the audio stream or simply mute/unmute it, e.g.:

```sh
amixer -D bluealsa sset '<control name>' 70%
```

where the control name is the name of a connected Bluetooth device with a control element suffix,
e.g.:

```sh
amixer -D bluealsa sset 'Jabra MOVE v2.3.0 A2DP' 50%
```

For more advanced ALSA configuration, consult the [asoundrc on-line
documentation](https://www.alsa-project.org/main/index.php/Asoundrc) provided by the AlsaProject
wiki page.

## Troubleshooting

1. Using BlueALSA alongside with PulseAudio.

   Due to BlueZ limitations, it seems, that it is not possible to use BlueALSA and PulseAudio to
   handle Bluetooth audio together. BlueZ can not handle more than one application which registers
   audio profile in the Bluetooth stack. However, it is possible to run BlueALSA and PulseAudio
   alongside, but Bluetooth support has to be disabled in the PulseAudio. Any Bluetooth related
   module has to be unloaded - e.g. `bluetooth-discover`, `bluez5-discover`.

2. ALSA thread-safe API (alsa-lib >= 1.1.2, <= 1.1.3).

   Starting from ALSA library 1.1.2, it is possible to enable thread-safe API functions. It is a
   noble change, but the implementation leaves a lot to be desired. This "minor" change does not
   affect hardware audio devices (because for hardware devices, this change is disabled), but it
   affects A LOT all software plug-ins. Random deadlocks are inevitable. My personal advice is to
   disable it during alsa-lib configuration step (`./configure --disable-thread-safety`), or if
   it is not possible (installation from a package repository), disable it via an environmental
   variable, as follows: `export LIBASOUND_THREAD_SAFE=0`.

3. Couldn't acquire D-Bus name: org.bluealsa

   It is not possible to run more than one instance of the BlueALSA server per D-Bus interface. If
   one tries to run second instance, it will fail with the `"Couldn't acquire D-Bus name:
   org.bluealsa"` error message. This message might also appear when D-Bus policy does not allow
   acquiring "org.bluealsa" name for a particular user - by default only root is allowed to start
   BlueALSA server.

4. Couldn't get BlueALSA PCM: PCM not found

   In contrast to standard ALSA sound cards, BlueALSA does not expose all PCMs right away. In the
   first place it is required to connect remote Bluetooth device with desired Bluetooth profile -
   run `bluealsa --help` for the list of available profiles. For querying currently connected audio
   profiles (and connected devices), run `bluealsa-aplay --list-devices`. The common misconception
   is an attempt to use A2DP playback device as a capture one in case where A2DP is not listed in
   the "List of CAPTURE Bluetooth Devices" section.

   Additionally, the cause of the "PCM not found" error might be an incorrect ALSA PCM name. Run
   `bluealsa-aplay --list-pcms` for the list of currently available ALSA PCM names - it might give
   you a hint what is wrong with your `.asoundrc` entry. Also, take a look at the
   [bluealsa-plugins man page](./doc/bluealsa-plugins.7.rst).
