Object path     [variable prefix]/

Methods         array{object, dict} GetPCMs()

                        Returns the array of available PCM objects and
                        associated properties.

Signals         void PCMAdded(object path, dict props)

                        Signal emitted when new PCM is added. It contains
                        the object path and associated properties.

                void PCMRemoved(object path)

                        Signal emitted when device has been removed. The
                        object path is only for a reference - it has been
                        already removed.

Methods         fd, fd Open(string mode)

                        Open PCM stream in a given operation mode. This method
                        returns two file descriptors, respectively PCM stream
                        PIPE and PCM controller SEQPACKET socket.

                        Controller socket commands: "Drain", "Drop", "Pause",
                                                    "Resume"

                        Possible Errors: dbus.Error.InvalidArguments
                                         dbus.Error.NotSupported
                                         dbus.Error.Failed

Properties      object Device [readonly]

                        BlueZ device object path.

                array{string} Modes [readonly]

                        Available operation modes.

                        Possible values: "sink" or "source"

                byte Channels [readonly]

                        Number of audio channels.

                uint32 Sampling [readonly]

                        Sampling frequency.

                uint16 Codec [readonly]

                        Bluetooth transport codec.

                uint16 Delay [readonly]

                        Approximate PCM delay in 1/10 of millisecond.

                uint16 Volume [readwrite]

                        This property holds PCM volume and mute information
                        for channel 1 (left) and 2 (right) or playback and
                        capture for SCO. Data for channel 1 and playback is
                        stored in the upper byte, while channel 2 and capture
                        is stored in the lower byte. The highest bit of both
                        bytes determines whether channel is muted.

                        Possible A2DP values: 0-127
                        Possible SCO values: 0-15
