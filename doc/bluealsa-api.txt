Methods         array{object, dict} GetPCMs()

                        Returns the array of available PCM objects and
                        associated properties.

Signals         void PCMAdded(object path, dict props)

                        Signal emitted when new PCM is added. It contains
                        the object path and associated properties.

                void PCMRemoved(object path)

                        Signal emitted when device has been removed. The
                        object path is only for a reference - it has been
                        already removed.

                        Version of BlueALSA service.

                array{string} Adapters [readonly]

                        Used HCI adapters. The device names ("hci0", etc.) of

Object path     [variable prefix]/{hci0,...}/dev_XX_XX_XX_XX_XX_XX/[type]/[mode]

Methods         fd, fd Open()

                        Open BlueALSA PCM stream. This method returns two file
                        descriptors, respectively PCM stream PIPE and PCM
                        controller SEQPACKET socket.

                        Controller socket commands: "Drain", "Drop", "Pause",
                                                    "Resume"

                        Possible Errors: dbus.Error.InvalidArguments

                                         dbus.Error.Failed

                array{string, dict} GetCodecs()

                        Return the array of additional PCM codecs. Client can
                        switch to one of these codecs with the SelectCodec()
                        D-Bus method call.

                void SelectCodec(string codec, dict props)

                        Select PCM codec. This call shall be made before PCM
                        stream opening for given transport type, otherwise the
                        ongoing stream (or PCM counterpart: sink, source) will
                        be terminated.

                        For A2DP codecs, client can override build-in logic
                        for selecting codec configuration by providing the
                        configuration blob via the "Configuration" property.

                        Possible Errors: dbus.Error.InvalidArguments

Properties      object Device [readonly]

                        BlueZ device object path.

                uint32 Sequence [readonly]

                        This property indicates the sequence in which devices
                        connected. The larger the value, the later the device
                        was connected.

                string Transport [readonly]

                        Underlying Bluetooth transport type.

                        Possible values: "A2DP-sink", "A2DP-source", "HFP-AG",
                                         "HFP-HF", "HSP-AG" or "HSP-HS"

                string Mode [readonly]

                        PCM stream operation mode (direction).

                        Possible values: "sink" or "source"

                uint16 Format [readonly]

                        Stream format identifier. The highest two bits of the
                        16-bit identifier determine the signedness and the
                        endianness. Next 6 bits determine the physical width
                        of a sample in bytes. The lowest 8 bits are used to
                        store the actual sample bit-width.

                        Examples: 0x4210 - unsigned 16-bit 2 bytes big-endian
                                  0x8418 - signed 24-bit 4 bytes little-endian

                byte Channels [readonly]

                        Number of audio channels.

                uint32 Sampling [readonly]

                        Sampling frequency.

                uint16 Codec [readonly]

                        Bluetooth transport codec. The meaning of this value
                        depends on the Bluetooth transport type.

                uint16 Delay [readonly]

                        Approximate PCM delay in 1/10 of millisecond.

                boolean SoftVolume [readwrite]

                        This property determines whether BlueALSA will make
                        volume control internally or will delegate this task
                        to BlueALSA PCM client or connected Bluetooth device
                        respectively for PCM sink or PCM source.

                uint16 Volume [readwrite]

                        This property holds volume (loudness) value and mute
                        information for channel 1 (left) and 2 (right). Data
                        for channel 1 is stored in the upper byte, channel 2
                        is stored in the lower byte. The highest bit of both
                        bytes determines whether channel is muted.

                        Possible A2DP values: 0-127
                        Possible SCO values: 0-15

Object path     [variable prefix]/{hci0,hci1,...}/dev_XX_XX_XX_XX_XX_XX/rfcomm

Methods         fd Open()

                        Open RFCOMM socket for dispatching AT commands not
                        handled internally by BlueALSA. This method returns
                        a SEQPACKET socket.

                        Possible Errors: dbus.Error.NotSupported

Properties      string Transport [readonly]

                        HFP/HSP transport type.

                        Possible values: "HFP-AG", "HFP-HF", "HSP-AG" or
                                         "HSP-HS"

                uint32 Features [readonly]

                        HFP feature bitmask. Note, that this value depends on
                        the connection mode.

                byte Battery [readonly]

                        Remote device battery level.

                        Possible values: 0-100 or -1
